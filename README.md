# Description

This game is a basic 2D implementation of well known game FarmVille game. There is a farmer and he is able to plant different vegetables, fruits and harvest to sell them. All fruits and vegetables have different growing times, different seed costs and sale prices. Farmer has tools to take care of each plant as different tools for planting and harvesting.  Since, it is a classic 1 player farming simulator there will be no losing, but game will end automatically when player runs out of money and there is nothing left to harvest. Our aim is to create this game by Object Oriented Programming. We will implement this game by JAVA.
